[Dani Brake](https://danibrake.org)'s Matlab utilities for 

* dealing with [Bertini1](http://bertini.nd.edu), and 
* their other common Matlab needs, such as easily rendering figures into files.

### How to use

* Add the repo subfolders to your Matlab path
    * `brakelab/bertini1`
    * `brakelab/rendering`
    * `brakelab/util`

Matlab's add with subfolders functionality doesn't play nicely with a Git repo...  so manually add the folders.  Might I recommend moving to the root of brakelab first, so the dialogue starts at the correct root for each add?  Or, use the command line commands to modify and save your path!
